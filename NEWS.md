# SSNbler 1.1.0

## Major updates

* Modified `lines_to_lsn()` and added various internal helper functions to support topology checking in parallel. Overcomes a 32-bit matrix indexing limitation in R (2^31-1), which in practice had limited the number of input `streams` LINESTRING features to 46340.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed bug in `updist_sites()` when `length_col already exists.
* Fixed bugs in `updist_sites()` and `afv_sites()` which caused error when skipping sf object and `length(sites) == 1`.
* Fixed bug in `updist_sites()` which occurred when the sf object didn't exist in `lsn_path` and arguments `save_local = TRUE` and `overwrite = FALSE`.
* Fixed bug in `lines_to_lsn()`, which caused the function to fail when `check_topology = FALSE`.
* Fixed bug in `lines_to_lsn()`, which caused some outlets to flagged as dangling node errors when they were not within `topo_tolerance` of another edge vertex or end node.
* Fixed logic error in `lines_to_lsn()`, where outlets with three features flowing in were not being flagged as toplogical errors.
* In `lines_to_lsn()`, added a check whether line features in streams have a length shorter than `snap_tolerance`. This prevents the end nodes of a short line feature from being snapped together (forming a loop) when `check_topology = TRUE`. When this occurs an informative error message is returned.
